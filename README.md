Transform your chaotic Google Photos Takeout into organized photo libraries with proper dates, albums, and metadata.

## What This Tool Does

When you export photos from Google Photos using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/), you get a mess of folders with weird `.json` files and broken timestamps. This tool:

- ‚úÖ **Organizes photos chronologically** with correct dates
- ‚úÖ **Restores album structure** with multiple handling options
- ‚úÖ **Fixes timestamps** from JSON metadata and EXIF data
- ‚úÖ **Writes GPS coordinates and timestamps** back to media files
- ‚úÖ **Removes duplicates** automatically
- ‚úÖ **Handles special formats** (HEIC, Motion Photos, etc.)

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Photos from Google Takeout

1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/)
2. Deselect all, then select only **Google Photos**
3. Download all ZIP files

### 2. Extract and Merge

Unzip all files and merge them so you have one unified "Takeout" folder.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Keep the original ZIPs as backup!**

### 3. Install Prerequisites

**ExifTool** (required for metadata handling):

- **Windows**: Download from [exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org/) and rename `exiftool(-k).exe` to `exiftool.exe`
  ```bash
  # Or with Chocolatey:
  choco install exiftool
  ```
- **Mac**: 
  ```bash
  brew install exiftool
  ```
- **Linux**: 
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl
  ```

### 4. Download and Run GPTH

1. Download the latest executable from [releases](https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/releases)
2. **Interactive Mode** (recommended for beginners):
   - Windows: Double-click `gpth.exe`
   - Mac/Linux: Run `./gpth-macos` or `./gpth-linux` in terminal
3. Follow the prompts to select input/output folders and options

## Album Handling Options

GPTH offers several ways to handle your Google Photos albums:

### üîó Shortcut (Recommended)
Creates shortcuts/symlinks from album folders to files in `ALL_PHOTOS`. Saves space while maintaining organization.

### üìÅ Duplicate Copy
Creates actual file copies in both `ALL_PHOTOS` and album folders. Uses more space but works across all systems.

### üîÑ Reverse Shortcut
Files stay in album folders, shortcuts created in `ALL_PHOTOS`. Good for album-centric organization.

### üìÑ JSON
Single `ALL_PHOTOS` folder plus `albums-info.json` with metadata. Most space-efficient, programmatically accessible.

### ‚ùå Nothing
Ignores albums entirely, creates only `ALL_PHOTOS`. Simplest option.

## Command Line Usage

For automation, headless systems, or advanced users:

```bash
gpth --input "/path/to/takeout" --output "/path/to/organized" --albums "shortcut"
```

### Core Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--input`, `-i` | Input folder containing extracted Takeout |
| `--output`, `-o` | Output folder for organized photos |
| `--albums` | Album handling: `shortcut`, `duplicate-copy`, `reverse-shortcut`, `json`, `nothing` |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show help and exit |

### Organization Options

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--divide-to-dates` | Folder structure: `0`=one folder, `1`=by year, `2`=year/month, `3`=year/month/day |
| `--copy` | Copy files instead of moving (safer but uses more space) |
| `--skip-extras` | Skip extra images like "-edited" versions |

### Metadata & Processing

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--write-exif` | Write GPS coordinates and dates to EXIF metadata |
| `--modify-json` | Fix JSON files with "supplemental-metadata" suffix |
| `--transform-pixel-mp` | Convert Pixel Motion Photos (.MP/.MV) to .mp4 |
| `--guess-from-name` | Extract dates from filenames (enabled by default) |
| `--update-creation-time` | Sync creation time with modified time (Windows only) |
| `--limit-filesize` | Skip files larger than 64MB (for low-RAM systems) |

### Other Options

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--interactive` | Force interactive mode |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Show detailed logging output |
| `--fix` | Special mode: fix dates in any folder (not just Takeout) |

### Example Commands

**Basic usage:**
```bash
gpth --input "~/Takeout" --output "~/Photos" --albums "shortcut"
```

**Copy files with year folders:**
```bash
gpth --input "~/Takeout" --output "~/Photos" --copy --divide-to-dates 1
```

**Full metadata processing:**
```bash
gpth --input "~/Takeout" --output "~/Photos" --write-exif --transform-pixel-mp --albums "duplicate-copy"
```

**Fix dates in existing folder:**
```bash
gpth --fix "~/existing-photos"
```

## Features & Capabilities

### üìÖ Date Extraction
GPTH uses multiple methods to determine correct photo dates:
1. **JSON metadata** (most accurate)
2. **EXIF data** from photo files
3. **Filename patterns** (Screenshot_20190919-053857.jpg, etc.)
4. **Aggressive matching** for difficult cases

### üîç Duplicate Detection
Removes identical files using content hashing, keeping the best copy (shortest filename, most metadata).

### üåç GPS Coordinates & Timestamps
Extracts location data and timestamps from JSON files and writes them to media file EXIF data for compatibility with photo viewers and other applications.

### üéØ Smart File Handling
- **Motion Photos**: Pixel .MP/.MV files can be converted to .mp4
- **HEIC/RAW support**: Handles modern camera formats
- **Unicode filenames**: Properly handles international characters
- **Large files**: Optional size limits for resource-constrained systems

### üìÅ Flexible Organization
- Multiple date-based folder structures
- Preserve or reorganize album structure
- Copy or move files (safety vs. efficiency)

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries
Download from [releases page](https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/releases)

### Package Managers
- **Arch Linux**: `yay -S gpth-bin`

### Building from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper.git
cd GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper
dart pub get
dart compile exe bin/gpth.dart -o gpth
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No photos found"**: Make sure you have a unified Takeout folder structure with "Photos from YYYY" folders.

**Permission errors**: Run with administrator/sudo privileges if moving files across drives.

**Memory issues**: Use `--limit-filesize` for systems with limited RAM.

**Encoding errors**: Some JSON files may have encoding issues; the tool handles most cases automatically.

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Windows**: Creation time updates require administrator privileges.

**macOS**: You may need to allow the executable in Security & Privacy settings.

**Linux**: Ensure ExifTool is installed for full functionality.

## After Migration

### Recommended Apps
- **[Immich](https://immich.app/)**: Self-hosted Google Photos alternative
- **[PhotoPrism](https://photoprism.org/)**: AI-powered photo management
- **[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)**: Sync photos across devices while preserving dates

### Android Users
Standard file managers reset photo dates when moving files. Use **Simple Gallery** to preserve timestamps.
